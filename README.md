# How Books Are Made

This is a site for the How Books Are Made podcast. It's built with Jekyll.

The live site deploys directly from the `live` branch, using CodeShip. Use https://howbooksaremade.netlify.app/ as the staging site, which builds from `master`.

Live deploys do not require a live tagging step.
